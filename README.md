# RecruitPlotEasy

RecruitPlotEasy is a tool aimed at assessing the quality of read recruitments to one or multiple genomes, with an aim at:
<br/>
* Identifying sequence-discrete populations among microbial communities
* Assessing depth and evenness of coverage over a genome
* Locating multiple copy genes in a misassembled genome
* Identifying highly conserved regions of a genome
* Identifying gene content differences across multiple samples of a microbial species
* Identifying the presence of closely-related microbial strains in the same community
<br/>
The plots are simple to use: install R through your preferred method, start an interactive R session, and execute the following R command:
<br/><br/>
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KGerhardt/Recplot_4/master/Recplot.R")
<br/><br/>
Doing so will bring up a graphical interface in your browser through which genomes and reads mapped to them can be turned into recruitment plots.
